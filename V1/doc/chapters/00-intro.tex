\chapter{Prelude}

Plantomation is a project started by a friend of mine who had the idea of a self-watering flower pot. After some deliberation and initial drafts he pulled out of it for personal reasons. 

I now restart the project because I always forget to water my house plants and eventually they all die. This will be a thing of the past thanks to this small project!

{\let\clearpage\relax \chapter{Introduction}}

Plantomation is an automatic plant watering system based on ESP32. It can handle up to four different plants simultaneously and is fully configurable via a simple web interface.

It uses capacitive soil moisture sensors to detect the humidity of the soil in the flower pot. Via a pump and valves, water can be delivered to the plants that need it. 

By applying a threshold, the amount of water used for plants can be customized to the plants specific needs.

The module is supplied by external 12V DC. Pumps and Valves are driven off 12V directly, moisture sensors are driven by 5V, the spillage sensor is connected to 3.3V.

Config and Log files are saved on the SD card.
